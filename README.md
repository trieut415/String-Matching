Given any text file, this program determines the nuumber of English words from a given dictionary file that appear in the text file 
that do not end with with same letter of the alphabet as your last name, in this case mine is Tra(n) thus excludes all words ending with an n.
The words do not have to be delimited by spaces or other punctuation in the file, and may overlap. The words have to be contiguous e.g: door$knob
or door knob will not find doorknob, but will still find door & knob. Duplicates are counted in this program, but can easily be adjusted to find unique words.
Another example is that the word "a" which is a dictionary word, can appear in the data more than once, and should be counted.
